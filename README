# OOPSAT - Object Oriented Power System Analysis Toolbox

OOPSAT is a rewrite of the original [PSAT](http://faraday1.ucd.ie/psat.html). While PSAT is a full-fledged power system analysis tool with a comprehensive UI, OOPSAT is an object oriented, command line based rewrite and by no means a replacement of PSAT.

OOPSAT enables
* easy integration with your own analysis framework/algortihms
* high scale automation
* easy parallelization

Supported features
* Power-flow analysis
* Small-signal stability anlysis

The core functionality is severly reduced but the underlying models and algorithms are mostly unchanged.

## Compatibilty
Compatible with R2019a or later. It might be compatible all the way back to R2008 as class definitions were introduced at that time.

Tested versions:

`MATLAB Version: 9.6.0.1307630 (R2019a) Update 7`

## Why ?
There are not too many open source projects that enable dynamic power system analysis and there are even less in MATLAB. OOPSAT was implemented as a neccessity to run small-signal stabiliyt analysis in an HPC cluster environment. Unfortunately it was impossible to use the original PSAT implementation for several reasons, thus a major rewrite was needed.
